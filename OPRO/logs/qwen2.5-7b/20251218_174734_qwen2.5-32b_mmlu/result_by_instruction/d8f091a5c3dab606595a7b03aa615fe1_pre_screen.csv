"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem, let's denote Noah's speed as \( N \) miles per hour.

Since Grady rides his bike \(60\%\) faster than Noah, Grady's speed can be expressed as:
\[ G = N + 0.6N = 1.6N \]

Given that both ride for two hours and Grady covers 12 miles more than Noah in this time, we can set up the following equations based on distance traveled:

- Distance covered by Noah: \( D_N = N \times 2 \)
- Distance covered by Grady: \( D_G = G \times 2 = 1.6N \times 2 = 3.2N \)

According to the problem, Grady rides 12 miles more than Noah:
\[ D_G - D_N = 12 \]
Substituting the expressions for \(D_G\) and \(D_N\):
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]

To find Noah's speed, we solve for \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10 \]

Thus, Noah rides at a speed of \( 10 \) miles per hour.

The correct answer is (C) 10.",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, consider each option's validity based on provided information or principles, and select the response that most accurately addresses the question.",2
"This question refers to the following information.
""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.
That is why we must no longer lag behind.""
Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931
The reference to the ""continual beatings"" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?
(A) The invasion of Afghanistan
(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact
(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe
(D) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II",B,"To analyze this question, we need to understand the context provided by Joseph Stalin's speech. He emphasizes the historical pattern where backwardness leads to being beaten and exploited by more powerful nations. This concept is central to his argument for not falling behind in any aspect.

Let's examine each option:

(A) The invasion of Afghanistan: While this was a significant event in Soviet history, it occurred much later (1979), after Stalin’s time. It does not directly align with the historical context provided by Stalin about backwardness leading to being beaten.

(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact: This was established in 1955 as a direct response to NATO's formation and aimed at countering Western influence, particularly from the United States. Given that it was created shortly after Stalin’s death but still within the context of his ideology, this could be seen as an effort to avoid being beaten by forming alliances.

(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe: This doctrine was articulated during Brezhnev's rule (1964-1982), emphasizing that the Soviet Union would intervene in any country where socialism was threatened. While it aligns with Stalin’s idea of not wanting to be beaten, it came later and is more about internal control rather than external alliances.

(D) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II: This occurred during World War II (1945), well before Stalin's speech in 1931. It does not fit within the context provided by Stalin’s speech.

Given this analysis, option (B) is the most directly supported by the historical context and reasoning presented in Stalin's speech about avoiding backwardness and being beaten.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact",0.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, consider each option's validity based on provided information or principles, and select the response that most accurately addresses the question.",2
"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pins John originally had.

1. **Define Variables and Understand the Problem**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
   - Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he initially has \( 2x \) pins in total.

2. **Determine How Many Pins Were Given Away**:
   - John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.
   - One-third of one pile is \( \frac{x}{3} \).
   - Half of that amount is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{3} = \frac{x}{6} \).

3. **Calculate the Remaining Pins**:
   - After giving away \( \frac{x}{6} \) pins, John had 66 pins left.
   - Therefore, the remaining number of pins can be expressed as: 
     \[
     2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Combine like terms by finding a common denominator:
     \[
     2x - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{11x}{6}
     \]
   - Set the equation equal to 66 and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{11x}{6} = 66
     \]
     \[
     11x = 66 \times 6
     \]
     \[
     11x = 396
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{396}{11}
     \]
     \[
     x = 36
     \]

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Pins**:
   - Since \( x = 36 \), and John originally had two piles, he initially had:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 36 = 72
     \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, consider each option's validity based on provided information or principles, and select the response that most accurately addresses the question.",2
"At noon, an experimenter has 50 grams of a radioactive isotope. At noon 9 days later only 45 grams remain. To the nearest day, how many days after the experiment started will there be only 20 grams?
(A) 54
(B) 59
(C) 60
(D) 78",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand radioactive decay and use the information provided to determine the half-life of the isotope. Radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model.

Given:
- Initial amount at noon (Day 0): \( A_0 = 50 \) grams.
- Amount after 9 days: \( A(9) = 45 \) grams.

The formula for radioactive decay is given by:

\[ A(t) = A_0 e^{-\lambda t} \]

where:
- \( A(t) \) is the amount of substance at time \( t \),
- \( A_0 \) is the initial amount,
- \( \lambda \) is the decay constant,
- \( t \) is the time elapsed.

First, we need to find the decay constant \(\lambda\). Using the information that 45 grams remain after 9 days:

\[ 45 = 50 e^{-\lambda \cdot 9} \]

Solving for \(\lambda\):

\[ \frac{45}{50} = e^{-9\lambda} \]
\[ 0.9 = e^{-9\lambda} \]
\[ \ln(0.9) = -9\lambda \]
\[ \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.9)}{9} \]

Using the natural logarithm:

\[ \lambda \approx -\frac{-0.10536}{9} \approx 0.0117 \text{ per day} \]

Now, we need to find the time \( t \) when only 20 grams remain:

\[ 20 = 50 e^{-0.0117t} \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ \frac{20}{50} = e^{-0.0117t} \]
\[ 0.4 = e^{-0.0117t} \]
\[ \ln(0.4) = -0.0117t \]
\[ t = -\frac{\ln(0.4)}{0.0117} \]

Using the natural logarithm:

\[ t \approx -\frac{-0.9163}{0.0117} \approx 78 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, to the nearest day, it will take approximately 78 days for only 20 grams of the isotope to remain.

"A corporation is ________ from its managers, employees, investors and customers. It therefore has _______ succession and also ________.
(A) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets
(B) Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets
(C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets
(D) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets",C,"The correct answer is (C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets.

Let's break down the question and analyze each option:

1. **Independent**: A corporation is considered independent from its managers, employees, investors, and customers. This means that these groups do not control or directly manage the corporation; they have a stake in it but are separate entities.
   
2. **Perpetual**: Corporations can exist indefinitely unless dissolved by law or through some other legal process. This characteristic is known as perpetuity.

3. **Owns its own assets**: A corporation has distinct legal ownership of its assets, which means these assets cannot be directly taken away from the corporation except under specific circumstances such as liquidation.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets - This is incorrect because a corporation is distinguishable from its stakeholders and does own its assets.
(B) Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets - This is partially correct but the term ""Limited"" in this context might imply limited liability which isn't directly addressing independence or ownership of assets as comprehensively as option (C).
(C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets - This accurately describes a corporation.
(D) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets - This is incorrect because a corporation can be distinguished from its stakeholders.

Therefore, the most accurate response based on the principles and information provided is (C).",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, consider each option's validity based on provided information or principles, and select the response that most accurately addresses the question.",2
