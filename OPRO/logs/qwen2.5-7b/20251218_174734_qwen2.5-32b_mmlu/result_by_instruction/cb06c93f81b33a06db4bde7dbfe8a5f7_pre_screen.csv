"This question refers to the following information.
""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.
That is why we must no longer lag behind.""
Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931
The reference to the ""continual beatings"" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?
(A) The invasion of Afghanistan
(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact
(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe
(D) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II",B,"To answer this question, we need to carefully analyze how the reference to ""continual beatings"" in Joseph Stalin's speech relates to later Soviet foreign policy decisions. Let’s break down each option:

(A) **The invasion of Afghanistan**: This occurred much later, in 1979, under the leadership of Leonid Brezhnev and not directly related to the sentiment expressed by Stalin about falling behind and being beaten.

(B) **The creation of the Warsaw Pact**: This was established in 1955 as a direct response to NATO's formation. It can be seen as an effort to counter Western influence, which aligns with the idea that the Soviet Union did not want to fall behind or be beaten by other nations.

(C) **The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe**: This doctrine was articulated during Brezhnev's rule and was used to justify military intervention in Eastern European countries. It reflects a desire to prevent any weakening or destabilization that could lead to the Soviet Union being beaten by other powers.

(D) **The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II**: This occurred in 1945, during Stalin's leadership but was more about fulfilling military objectives rather than a response to the idea of falling behind and being beaten.

Given that both (B) and (C) reflect actions taken by Soviet leaders who were influenced by the sentiment of not wanting to fall behind or be beaten, we need to consider which one most directly aligns with Stalin's speech. The creation of the Warsaw Pact was a more immediate and direct response to perceived threats from Western powers.

Therefore, the answer is:

(B) **The creation of the Warsaw Pact**",0.0,Analyze each option carefully before selecting the most appropriate answer.,1
"At noon, an experimenter has 50 grams of a radioactive isotope. At noon 9 days later only 45 grams remain. To the nearest day, how many days after the experiment started will there be only 20 grams?
(A) 54
(B) 59
(C) 60
(D) 78",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand radioactive decay and use the information given to determine the half-life of the isotope. Radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model.

Given:
- Initial amount \( A_0 = 50 \) grams.
- Amount after 9 days \( A = 45 \) grams.

The formula for radioactive decay is:

\[ A(t) = A_0 e^{-\lambda t} \]

where:
- \( A(t) \) is the amount of substance at time \( t \),
- \( A_0 \) is the initial amount,
- \( \lambda \) is the decay constant,
- \( t \) is the time elapsed.

First, we need to find the decay constant \( \lambda \). We know that after 9 days, the amount of substance has decreased from 50 grams to 45 grams. So:

\[ 45 = 50 e^{-\lambda \cdot 9} \]

Solving for \( \lambda \):

\[ \frac{45}{50} = e^{-9\lambda} \]
\[ 0.9 = e^{-9\lambda} \]
\[ \ln(0.9) = -9\lambda \]
\[ \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.9)}{9} \]

Using the natural logarithm:

\[ \lambda \approx -\frac{-0.10536}{9} \approx 0.0117 \text{ per day} \]

Now, we need to find the time \( t \) when only 20 grams remain. Using the decay formula again:

\[ 20 = 50 e^{-\lambda t} \]
\[ \frac{20}{50} = e^{-\lambda t} \]
\[ 0.4 = e^{-0.0117t} \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[ \ln(0.4) = -0.0117t \]
\[ t = -\frac{\ln(0.4)}{0.0117} \]

Using the natural logarithm again:

\[ t \approx -\frac{-0.9163}{0.0117} \approx 78 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, to the nearest day, it will take approximately 78 days for only 20 grams of the isotope to remain.

"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem, let's denote Noah's speed as \( N \) miles per hour.

Since Grady rides his bike \(60\%\) faster than Noah, Grady's speed can be expressed as:
\[ G = N + 0.6N = 1.6N \]

Given that both ride for two hours and Grady covers \(12\) miles more than Noah in this time, we can set up the following equations based on their distances traveled:

- Distance covered by Noah in two hours: 
\[ D_N = N \times 2 = 2N \]
- Distance covered by Grady in two hours:
\[ D_G = G \times 2 = 1.6N \times 2 = 3.2N \]

According to the problem, Grady rides \(12\) miles more than Noah:
\[ D_G - D_N = 12 \]
Substituting the expressions for \(D_G\) and \(D_N\):
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]

Solving for \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10 \]

Thus, Noah rides at a speed of \(10\) miles per hour.

"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pins John originally had.

1. **Define Variables and Understand the Problem**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
   - Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he initially has \( 2x \) pins in total.
   
2. **Determine How Many Pins Were Given Away**:
   - John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.
   - One-third of one pile is \( \frac{x}{3} \).
   - Half of that amount is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{3} = \frac{x}{6} \).

3. **Calculate the Remaining Pins**:
   - After giving away \( \frac{x}{6} \) pins, John had 66 pins left.
   - Therefore, the remaining number of pins can be expressed as: 
     \[
     2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Combine like terms by finding a common denominator:
     \[
     2x - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{11x}{6}
     \]
   - Set the equation equal to 66 and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{11x}{6} = 66
     \]
     \[
     11x = 66 \times 6
     \]
     \[
     11x = 396
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{396}{11}
     \]
     \[
     x = 36
     \]

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Pins**:
   - Since \( x = 36 \), and John originally had two piles, he initially had:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 36 = 72
     \]

"A corporation is ________ from its managers, employees, investors and customers. It therefore has _______ succession and also ________.
(A) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets
(B) Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets
(C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets
(D) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets",C,"The correct answer is (C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets.

Let's break down the options:

- **Independent**: A corporation operates independently of its managers, employees, investors, and customers. It can make decisions and conduct business without direct dependence on these groups.
  
- **Perpetual**: Corporations are typically structured in a way that allows them to continue indefinitely unless they dissolve or are liquidated.

- **Owns its own assets**: A corporation is considered an entity with legal rights and responsibilities, including the ownership of assets. This means it can acquire, hold, and dispose of property as needed for business purposes.

Option (A) is incorrect because ""indistinguishable"" does not accurately describe a corporation's relationship with its stakeholders.
Option (B) is partially correct but uses ""Limited,"" which refers to liability rather than the independence or asset ownership described in the question.
Option (D) incorrectly states that a corporation is ""Indistinguishable"" from its stakeholders, which contradicts the nature of corporate structure.

Therefore, option (C) accurately describes the characteristics of a corporation.",1.0,Analyze each option carefully before selecting the most appropriate answer.,1
