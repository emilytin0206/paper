"At noon, an experimenter has 50 grams of a radioactive isotope. At noon 9 days later only 45 grams remain. To the nearest day, how many days after the experiment started will there be only 20 grams?
(A) 54
(B) 59
(C) 60
(D) 78",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand radioactive decay and use the given information to determine the half-life of the isotope. Radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, which can be described by the formula:

\[ N(t) = N_0 \cdot e^{-\lambda t} \]

where:
- \(N(t)\) is the amount of substance at time \(t\),
- \(N_0\) is the initial amount,
- \(\lambda\) is the decay constant, and
- \(t\) is the time elapsed.

However, for simplicity in this problem, we can use a simpler form based on half-life:

\[ N(t) = N_0 \cdot 2^{-\frac{t}{T}} \]

where:
- \(N(t)\) is the amount of substance at time \(t\),
- \(N_0\) is the initial amount,
- \(T\) is the half-life, and
- \(t\) is the time elapsed.

Given that we have 50 grams initially and after 9 days, only 45 grams remain, we can use this information to find the half-life. Let's denote the half-life as \(T\).

\[ 45 = 50 \cdot 2^{-\frac{9}{T}} \]

Solving for \(T\):

\[ \frac{45}{50} = 2^{-\frac{9}{T}} \]
\[ 0.9 = 2^{-\frac{9}{T}} \]

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

\[ \ln(0.9) = -\frac{9}{T} \cdot \ln(2) \]
\[ T = -\frac{9 \cdot \ln(2)}{\ln(0.9)} \]

Using approximate values:
- \(\ln(2) \approx 0.693\)
- \(\ln(0.9) \approx -0.105\)

So,

\[ T = -\frac{9 \cdot 0.693}{-0.105} \approx 60 \text{ days} \]

Now, we need to find the time \(t\) when only 20 grams remain:

\[ 20 = 50 \cdot 2^{-\frac{t}{T}} \]
\[ \frac{20}{50} = 2^{-\frac{t}{60}} \]
\[ 0.4 = 2^{-\frac{t}{60}} \]

Taking the natural logarithm on both sides:

\[ \ln(0.4) = -\frac{t}{60} \cdot \ln(2) \]
\[ t = -60 \cdot \frac{\ln(0.4)}{\ln(2)} \]

Using approximate values:
- \(\ln(0.4) \approx -0.916\)

So,

\[ t = -60 \cdot \frac{-0.916}{0.693} \approx 78 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) 78 days.",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement carefully, use relevant principles or data provided, evaluate each option critically against these criteria, and select the response that most accurately answers the question.",3
"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem, let's denote the speed of Noah as \( N \) miles per hour.

Since Grady rides his bike \(60\%\) faster than Noah, we can express Grady's speed in terms of Noah's speed:
\[ G = N + 0.6N = 1.6N \]

Next, let's calculate the distance each brother travels in two hours.
- Distance traveled by Noah in two hours: \( D_N = N \times 2 \)
- Distance traveled by Grady in two hours: \( D_G = G \times 2 = 1.6N \times 2 = 3.2N \)

According to the problem, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah in two hours:
\[ D_G - D_N = 12 \]
Substituting the expressions for \( D_G \) and \( D_N \):
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]
Simplifying this equation:
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]

To find Noah's speed, we solve for \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10 \]

Thus, Noah rides at a speed of \( 10 \) miles per hour.

The correct answer is (C) 10.",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement carefully, use relevant principles or data provided, evaluate each option critically against these criteria, and select the response that most accurately answers the question.",3
"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the Variables and Understand the Problem Statement**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
   - Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he originally had \( 2x \) pins.
   - He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. This means he gave away \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \times x = \frac{x}{6}\).
   - After giving away these pins, John had 66 pins left.

2. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - The number of pins John originally had minus the number he gave to his brother equals the number of pins he has left.
   - Therefore, \( 2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66 \).

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Combine like terms: \( 2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66 \).
   - To combine the terms on the left side, find a common denominator (which is 6): \( \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = 66 \).
   - Simplify: \( \frac{11x}{6} = 66 \).
   - Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction: \( 11x = 396 \).
   - Divide both sides by 11: \( x = 36 \).

4. **Determine the Original Number of Pins**:
   - Since \( x \) is the number of pins in one pile, and John originally had two piles, he originally had \( 2x = 2 \times 36 = 72 \) pins.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,"Analyze the problem statement carefully, use relevant principles or data provided, evaluate each option critically against these criteria, and select the response that most accurately answers the question.",3
"This question refers to the following information.
""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.
That is why we must no longer lag behind.""
Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931
The reference to the ""continual beatings"" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?
(A) The invasion of Afghanistan
(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact
(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe
(D) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II",B,"To analyze this question, we need to understand the context provided by Joseph Stalin's speech. The reference to ""continual beatings"" is a metaphor for the historical and ongoing exploitation and oppression that Russia (and later the Soviet Union) faced due to its backwardness in various aspects such as military, cultural, political, industrial, and agricultural.

Let's evaluate each option:

(A) **The invasion of Afghanistan**: This occurred much later, in 1979. The speech was delivered in 1931, long before the events leading up to the Soviet-Afghan War. While this event aligns with the theme of defending against perceived threats and backwardness, it is not directly supported by Stalin's specific reference.

(B) **The creation of the Warsaw Pact**: This occurred in 1955, following World War II. The speech was delivered during a time when the Soviet Union was still consolidating its power after the war. The idea of creating an alliance to counteract perceived threats and ensure security aligns well with Stalin's rhetoric about not falling behind.

(C) **The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe**: This doctrine was more prominently used during the 1960s, particularly after the Prague Spring in 1968. While it fits the theme of defending against perceived threats and maintaining control over satellite states, it is not directly supported by Stalin's specific reference.

(D) **The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II**: This occurred in August 1945, which was after Stalin’s speech. The speech focused on internal backwardness and external threats but did not specifically mention a future military engagement with Japan.

Given these considerations, the option that most directly supports the idea of not falling behind and taking action to ensure security against perceived threats is:

(B) **The creation of the Warsaw Pact**

This decision aligns well with Stalin's emphasis on avoiding backwardness and ensuring the Soviet Union’s strength in a hostile world.",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement carefully, use relevant principles or data provided, evaluate each option critically against these criteria, and select the response that most accurately answers the question.",3
"A corporation is ________ from its managers, employees, investors and customers. It therefore has _______ succession and also ________.
(A) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets
(B) Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets
(C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets
(D) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets",C,"To answer this question accurately, let's break down the problem statement and analyze each option.

The sentence states that a corporation is something from managers, employees, investors, and customers. It also mentions two outcomes of this state: perpetual succession and owning its own assets.

1. **Independent vs Indistinguishable**:
   - A corporation is typically described as independent from its stakeholders (managers, employees, investors, and customers). This means it operates separately and has distinct legal status.
   - ""Indistinguishable"" would imply that the corporation cannot be distinguished from these other entities, which does not align with how corporations are generally understood.

2. **Perpetual Succession**:
   - Perpetual succession refers to a situation where a business entity can continue indefinitely without being dissolved due to the death or departure of its owners.
   - This is a characteristic often associated with corporations and distinguishes them from partnerships, for example.

3. **Ownership of Assets**:
   - Corporations do own their assets as they are separate legal entities that can acquire, hold, and dispose of property in their own name.

Given these points, let's evaluate the options:

- (A) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets: This is incorrect because corporations are distinguishable from their stakeholders and do own their assets.
- (B) Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets: The term ""limited"" here might refer to limited liability, which is a characteristic of corporations but does not fit the context as well as ""perpetual.""
- (C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets: This option correctly identifies that a corporation is independent from its stakeholders and has perpetual succession. It also accurately states that a corporation owns its own assets.
- (D) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets: As mentioned earlier, corporations are not indistinguishable from their stakeholders.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets.**",0.0,"Analyze the problem statement carefully, use relevant principles or data provided, evaluate each option critically against these criteria, and select the response that most accurately answers the question.",3
