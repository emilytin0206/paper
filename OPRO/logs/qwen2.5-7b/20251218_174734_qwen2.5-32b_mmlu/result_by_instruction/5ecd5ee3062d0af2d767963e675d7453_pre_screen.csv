"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem, let's denote Noah's speed as \( N \) miles per hour.

Since Grady rides his bike \(60\%\) faster than Noah, Grady's speed can be expressed as:
\[ G = N + 0.6N = 1.6N \]

In two hours, the distance each of them travels is given by their speed multiplied by time (2 hours).

For Noah:
\[ \text{Distance traveled by Noah} = N \times 2 = 2N \]

For Grady:
\[ \text{Distance traveled by Grady} = G \times 2 = 1.6N \times 2 = 3.2N \]

According to the problem, Grady rides \(12\) miles further than Noah in two hours. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]

Solving for \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10 \]

Thus, Noah rides at a speed of \( 10 \) miles per hour.

The correct answer is (C) 10.",1.0,"Carefully examine each option, aligning it with the provided information or principles, and select the response that most accurately addresses the question.",2
"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
2. Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he originally had \( 2x \) pins.
3. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. This means he gave away:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times \left(\frac{1}{3} \times x\right) = \frac{x}{6}
   \]
4. After giving away \( \frac{x}{6} \), John had 66 pins left. Therefore, the number of pins he originally had minus the number of pins he gave away equals 66:
   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
   \]
5. To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms by finding a common denominator:
   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{11x}{6}
   \]
6. Set the equation equal to 66 and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{11x}{6} = 66
   \]
7. Multiply both sides by 6:
   \[
   11x = 396
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 11:
   \[
   x = 36
   \]

Since \( x \) is the number of pins in one pile, and John originally had two piles, he originally had:
\[
2x = 2 \times 36 = 72
\]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,"Carefully examine each option, aligning it with the provided information or principles, and select the response that most accurately addresses the question.",2
"This question refers to the following information.
""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.
That is why we must no longer lag behind.""

The reference to the ""continual beatings"" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?
(A) The invasion of Afghanistan
(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact
(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe
(D) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II",B,"The reference to ""continual beatings"" most directly supports the decision made under Joseph Stalin's influence, emphasizing the need for the Soviet Union not to fall behind and to assert its strength. This principle aligns with the idea that backwardness leads to being beaten, which can be seen as a rationale for taking strong actions to ensure the USSR does not face such a fate.

Among the given options:

(A) The invasion of Afghanistan – While this was a significant event in Soviet history, it is more related to Cold War politics and ideological confrontation rather than directly stemming from the fear of being beaten due to backwardness.

(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact – This was indeed driven by the need for mutual defense against perceived threats, especially after the U.S. and NATO's expansion. It can be seen as a direct response to the fear of falling behind or being isolated in a hostile environment.

(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine – This doctrine was used to assert Soviet control over satellite states and suppress dissent, but it is more about internal control rather than external threats leading to backwardness.

(D) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II – This decision was based on strategic military considerations during a specific historical context and not directly related to the fear of being beaten due to backwardness.

Given this analysis, the most accurate answer is:

(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact

This option best aligns with the principle that the Soviet Union needed to avoid falling behind and facing external threats by forming alliances for mutual defense.",0.0,"Carefully examine each option, aligning it with the provided information or principles, and select the response that most accurately addresses the question.",2
"At noon, an experimenter has 50 grams of a radioactive isotope. At noon 9 days later only 45 grams remain. To the nearest day, how many days after the experiment started will there be only 20 grams?
(A) 54
(B) 59
(C) 60
(D) 78",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand radioactive decay and use the information given to determine the half-life of the isotope. Radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model.

Given:
- Initial amount \( N_0 = 50 \) grams.
- Amount after 9 days \( N(9) = 45 \) grams.

The formula for radioactive decay is:

\[ N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t} \]

where:
- \( N(t) \) is the amount of substance at time \( t \),
- \( N_0 \) is the initial amount,
- \( \lambda \) is the decay constant,
- \( t \) is the time elapsed.

First, we need to find the decay constant \( \lambda \). Using the information that 45 grams remain after 9 days:

\[ 45 = 50 e^{-\lambda \cdot 9} \]

Solving for \( \lambda \):

\[ \frac{45}{50} = e^{-9\lambda} \]
\[ 0.9 = e^{-9\lambda} \]
\[ \ln(0.9) = -9\lambda \]
\[ \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.9)}{9} \]

Now, we need to find the time \( t \) when only 20 grams remain:

\[ 20 = 50 e^{-\lambda t} \]

Substitute \( \lambda \):

\[ 20 = 50 e^{\left(\frac{\ln(0.9)}{9}\right)t} \]
\[ \frac{20}{50} = e^{\left(\frac{\ln(0.9)}{9}\right)t} \]
\[ 0.4 = e^{\left(\frac{\ln(0.9)}{9}\right)t} \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[ \ln(0.4) = \left(\frac{\ln(0.9)}{9}\right)t \]
\[ t = \frac{9 \ln(0.4)}{\ln(0.9)} \]

Now, calculate \( t \):

\[ t = \frac{9 \cdot (-0.9163)}{-0.1054} \approx 82.7 \text{ days} \]

Since we need the answer to the nearest day:

"A corporation is ________ from its managers, employees, investors and customers. It therefore has _______ succession and also ________.
(A) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets
(B) Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets
(C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets
(D) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets",C,"The correct answer is (C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets.

Explanation:
- **Independent**: A corporation is an independent legal entity separate from its managers, employees, investors, and customers. This means the corporation can enter into contracts, hold property, and be sued in its own name.
- **Perpetual**: Corporations are typically structured to exist indefinitely unless they are dissolved through a formal process. This perpetual nature allows for succession without interruption.
- **Owns its own assets**: A corporation is considered an entity that owns the assets it purchases or receives as gifts, and can be held liable for debts in its name.

The other options do not accurately reflect these principles:
- (A) ""Indistinguishable"" does not fit with a corporation being separate from individuals.
- (B) While corporations are independent and own their assets, they are not limited in the sense that they have no inherent lifespan unless dissolved.
- (D) ""Indistinguishable"" again is incorrect for the same reason as option A.
