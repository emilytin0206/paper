"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pins John originally had.

1. **Define Variables and Understand the Problem**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
   - Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he initially has \( 2x \) pins in total.

2. **Determine How Many Pins Were Given Away**:
   - John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.
   - One-third of one pile is \( \frac{x}{3} \).
   - Half of that amount is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{3} = \frac{x}{6} \).

3. **Calculate the Remaining Pins**:
   - After giving away \( \frac{x}{6} \) pins, John had 66 pins left.
   - Therefore, the remaining number of pins can be expressed as: 
     \[
     x + x - \frac{x}{6} = 2x - \frac{x}{6}
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     2x - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{11x}{6}
     \]
   - We know that this equals 66 pins:
     \[
     \frac{11x}{6} = 66
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     11x = 396
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 11:
     \[
     x = 36
     \]

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Pins**:
   - Since \( x \) is the number of pins in one pile, and John originally had two piles:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 36 = 72
     \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, consider each option critically, and choose the answer that most accurately and directly responds to the query based on the provided information.",2
"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem, let's denote Noah's speed as \( N \) miles per hour.

Since Grady rides his bike \(60\%\) faster than Noah, Grady's speed can be expressed as:
\[ G = N + 0.6N = 1.6N \]

Given that both ride for two hours and Grady covers \(12\) miles more than Noah in this time, we can set up the following equations based on their distances traveled:

- Distance covered by Noah in two hours: 
\[ D_N = N \times 2 = 2N \]
- Distance covered by Grady in two hours:
\[ D_G = G \times 2 = 1.6N \times 2 = 3.2N \]

According to the problem, Grady rides \(12\) miles more than Noah:
\[ D_G - D_N = 12 \]
Substituting the expressions for \(D_G\) and \(D_N\):
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]

Solving for \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10 \]

Thus, Noah rides at a speed of \(10\) miles per hour.

The correct answer is (C) 10.",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, consider each option critically, and choose the answer that most accurately and directly responds to the query based on the provided information.",2
"This question refers to the following information.
""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.
That is why we must no longer lag behind.""
Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931
The reference to the ""continual beatings"" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?
(A) The invasion of Afghanistan
(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact
(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe
(D) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II",B,"The reference to ""continual beatings"" most directly supports the decision made under Joseph Stalin's influence, which emphasizes the need for the Soviet Union not to fall behind and to assert its strength. This sentiment aligns closely with the creation of the Warsaw Pact in 1955, as it was a response to perceived threats from Western powers and aimed at ensuring mutual defense among socialist states.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact

This option best reflects the historical context provided by Stalin's speech, where he underscores the importance of not falling behind or being beaten, which aligns with the strategic decision to form a collective security arrangement in Eastern Europe.",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, consider each option critically, and choose the answer that most accurately and directly responds to the query based on the provided information.",2
"At noon, an experimenter has 50 grams of a radioactive isotope. At noon 9 days later only 45 grams remain. To the nearest day, how many days after the experiment started will there be only 20 grams?
(A) 54
(B) 59
(C) 60
(D) 78",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The general formula for the amount of a substance remaining after time \( t \) is given by:

\[ N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t} \]

where:
- \( N(t) \) is the quantity at time \( t \),
- \( N_0 \) is the initial quantity,
- \( \lambda \) is the decay constant, and
- \( t \) is the time elapsed.

Given that 50 grams of a radioactive isotope decays to 45 grams in 9 days, we can use this information to find the half-life or directly calculate the decay constant. However, for simplicity, let's assume the decay follows a simple exponential model and use the given data points to estimate the time when only 20 grams remain.

First, we need to determine the rate of decay. The amount of isotope remaining after 9 days can be expressed as:

\[ N(9) = N_0 e^{-\lambda \cdot 9} \]

Given \( N_0 = 50 \) grams and \( N(9) = 45 \) grams, we have:

\[ 45 = 50 e^{-9\lambda} \]
\[ \frac{45}{50} = e^{-9\lambda} \]
\[ 0.9 = e^{-9\lambda} \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives us:

\[ \ln(0.9) = -9\lambda \]
\[ \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.9)}{9} \approx 0.0124356 \text{ per day} \]

Now, we need to find the time \( t \) when only 20 grams remain:

\[ N(t) = 50 e^{-\lambda t} = 20 \]
\[ \frac{20}{50} = e^{-\lambda t} \]
\[ 0.4 = e^{-0.0124356t} \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[ \ln(0.4) = -0.0124356t \]
\[ t = -\frac{\ln(0.4)}{0.0124356} \approx 78.9 \text{ days} \]

Rounding to the nearest day, we get \( t \approx 79 \) days.

However, since the options provided are (A) 54, (B) 59, (C) 60, and (D) 78, it seems there might be a discrepancy in the exact calculation or rounding. Given the closest option to our calculated value of approximately 79 days is:

"A corporation is ________ from its managers, employees, investors and customers. It therefore has _______ succession and also ________.
(A) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets
(B) Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets
(C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets
(D) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets",C,"The correct answer is (C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets.

Let's break down the question and analyze each option:

1. **Independent**: A corporation operates independently of its managers, employees, investors, and customers. This means that these groups can change or leave without affecting the ongoing operations of the corporation.
2. **Perpetual**: Corporations are typically structured in a way that allows them to continue indefinitely unless they dissolve voluntarily or through legal processes. This is different from partnerships or sole proprietorships which may end with the death or withdrawal of their owners.
3. **Owns its own assets**: A corporation can acquire, own, and dispose of assets independently, as it is recognized by law as a separate entity.

Now let's evaluate each option:

(A) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets - This is incorrect because corporations are distinguishable from their owners and do own assets.
(B) Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets - The term ""Limited"" here might refer to the liability of shareholders (limited liability), but it does not directly answer the question about independence or ownership of assets in a way that fits all parts of the sentence.
(C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets - This option correctly addresses all three aspects: independence from other parties, perpetual existence, and ownership of assets.
(D) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets - The term ""Indistinguishable"" is incorrect as explained above.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is (C).",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, consider each option critically, and choose the answer that most accurately and directly responds to the query based on the provided information.",2
