"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pins John originally had.

1. **Define Variables and Understand the Problem**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
   - Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he initially has \( 2x \) pins in total.

2. **Determine How Many Pins Were Given Away**:
   - John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.
   - One-third of one pile is \( \frac{x}{3} \).
   - Half of that amount is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{3} = \frac{x}{6} \).

3. **Calculate the Remaining Pins**:
   - John had 66 pins left after giving away \( \frac{x}{6} \) pins.
   - Therefore, the equation for the remaining pins is: 
     \[
     2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation**:
   - To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms by finding a common denominator:
     \[
     2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
     \]
     Convert \( 2x \) to have a denominator of 6:
     \[
     \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = 66
     \]
     Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{11x}{6} = 66
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     11x = 396
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 11:
     \[
     x = 36
     \]

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Pins**:
   - Since \( x \) is the number of pins in one pile, and John originally had two piles, he initially had:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 36 = 72
     \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, consider each option critically, and choose the answer that most accurately reflects the information given.",2
"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem, let's denote the speed of Noah as \( N \) miles per hour.

Since Grady rides his bike \(60\%\) faster than Noah, we can express Grady's speed as:
\[ G = N + 0.6N = 1.6N \]

Next, we know that in two hours, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah. We can set up the following equation based on their speeds and the time they ride:

For Noah: 
\[ \text{Distance} = N \times 2 \]
For Grady:
\[ \text{Distance} = G \times 2 = 1.6N \times 2 = 3.2N \]

According to the problem, Grady rides 12 miles more than Noah in two hours:
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]

Solving for \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10 \]

Thus, Noah rides at a speed of \( 10 \) miles per hour.

The correct answer is (C) 10.",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, consider each option critically, and choose the answer that most accurately reflects the information given.",2
"At noon, an experimenter has 50 grams of a radioactive isotope. At noon 9 days later only 45 grams remain. To the nearest day, how many days after the experiment started will there be only 20 grams?
(A) 54
(B) 59
(C) 60
(D) 78",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The general formula for the amount of a substance remaining after time \( t \) is given by:

\[ N(t) = N_0 e^{-\lambda t} \]

where:
- \( N(t) \) is the quantity at time \( t \),
- \( N_0 \) is the initial quantity,
- \( \lambda \) is the decay constant, and
- \( t \) is the time elapsed.

Given that 50 grams of a radioactive isotope remain as 45 grams after 9 days, we can use this information to find the half-life or the decay constant. However, for simplicity in this problem, let's assume the decay follows a simple exponential model where the amount halves every certain period (though not necessarily the half-life).

First, calculate the decay factor over 9 days:
\[ \frac{45}{50} = 0.9 \]

This means that after 9 days, the quantity is reduced to 90% of its original value.

To find out how many days it will take for the substance to reduce from 50 grams to 20 grams, we need to determine the number of such 9-day periods required to reach this level. We can set up the equation as follows:

\[ N(t) = N_0 \cdot (0.9)^{t/9} \]

We want \( N(t) = 20 \) grams when starting with \( N_0 = 50 \) grams:
\[ 20 = 50 \cdot (0.9)^{t/9} \]
\[ \frac{20}{50} = (0.9)^{t/9} \]
\[ 0.4 = (0.9)^{t/9} \]

To solve for \( t \), we take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[ \ln(0.4) = \ln((0.9)^{t/9}) \]
\[ \ln(0.4) = \frac{t}{9} \cdot \ln(0.9) \]

Solving for \( t \):
\[ t = 9 \cdot \frac{\ln(0.4)}{\ln(0.9)} \]

Using a calculator to find the values of the logarithms:
\[ \ln(0.4) \approx -0.9163 \]
\[ \ln(0.9) \approx -0.1054 \]

Thus,
\[ t = 9 \cdot \frac{-0.9163}{-0.1054} \approx 8.62 \text{ days per period} \]

Since we need to find the total number of periods (each being approximately 8.62 days) required for the substance to reduce from 50 grams to 20 grams, and knowing that each period is about 9 days:
\[ t \approx 9 \cdot 10 = 90 \text{ days} \]

However, since we need to find the nearest day when only 20 grams remain, considering the decay factor more precisely over these periods, it would be closer to 59 days.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"This question refers to the following information.
""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.
That is why we must no longer lag behind.""
Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931
The reference to the ""continual beatings"" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?
(A) The invasion of Afghanistan
(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact
(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe
(D) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II",B,"To analyze this question, we need to understand the context provided by Joseph Stalin's speech. He emphasizes the historical pattern where backwardness leads to being beaten and exploited by more powerful nations. This theme is central to his argument for not falling behind in any aspect.

Let's consider each option:

(A) The invasion of Afghanistan: While this was a significant event in Soviet history, it occurred much later (1979), well after Stalin’s time. It does not directly align with the historical context provided by Stalin about backwardness leading to being beaten.

(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact: This was established in 1955 as a direct response to NATO's formation and aimed at countering Western influence, particularly from the United States. Given that it was created shortly after Stalin’s death but still within the context of his ideology, this could be seen as an effort to avoid being beaten by forming alliances.

(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe: This doctrine was articulated during Brezhnev's rule (1964-1982), emphasizing that the Soviet Union would intervene in any country where socialism was threatened. While it aligns with Stalin’s idea of not wanting to be beaten, it came later and is more specific.

(D) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II: This occurred during World War II (1945), which predates Stalin's speech significantly. It does not fit well into the context provided by his argument about backwardness leading to being beaten.

Given this analysis, option (B) is the most accurate reflection of the information given in Stalin’s speech. The creation of the Warsaw Pact was a direct response to perceived threats and an effort to avoid being beaten by forming alliances with other socialist states.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact",0.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, consider each option critically, and choose the answer that most accurately reflects the information given.",2
"A corporation is ________ from its managers, employees, investors and customers. It therefore has _______ succession and also ________.
(A) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets
(B) Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets
(C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets
(D) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets",C,"To answer this question accurately, let's break down the sentence and analyze each part:

1. **""A corporation is ________ from its managers, employees, investors and customers.""**
   - This suggests that a corporation has some level of separation or distinction from these groups.
   
2. **""It therefore has _______ succession and also ________.""**
   - The first blank should indicate the nature of corporate succession (whether it's perpetual or not).
   - The second blank could refer to ownership of assets.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

(A) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets
- ""Indistinguishable"" suggests no separation, which contradicts the first part.
- ""Perpetual succession"" is correct for corporations as they can continue indefinitely.
- ""Does not own its own assets"" is incorrect; corporations do own their assets.

(B) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets
- ""Independent"" fits well with the idea of separation from managers, employees, investors, and customers.
- ""Perpetual succession"" is correct for corporations.
- ""Owns its own assets"" is accurate as a corporation can indeed own assets.

(C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets
- This option is identical to (B), so it's also correct based on the analysis.

(D) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets
- ""Indistinguishable"" suggests no separation, which contradicts the first part.
- ""Perpetual succession"" is correct for corporations.
- ""Owns its own assets"" is accurate as a corporation can indeed own assets.

Given this analysis, options (B) and (C) are both correct. However, since we need to choose one answer, and there's no additional context to differentiate between them, the most straightforward choice would be:

**Final Answer: (B) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets**
