"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pins John originally had.

1. **Define Variables and Understand the Problem**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
   - Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he initially has \( 2x \) pins in total.

2. **Determine How Many Pins Were Given Away**:
   - John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.
   - One-third of one pile is \( \frac{x}{3} \).
   - Half of that amount is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{3} = \frac{x}{6} \).

3. **Calculate the Remaining Pins**:
   - After giving away \( \frac{x}{6} \) pins, John had 66 pins left.
   - Therefore, the remaining number of pins can be expressed as: 
     \[
     2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Combine like terms by finding a common denominator:
     \[
     2x - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{11x}{6}
     \]
   - Set the equation equal to 66 and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{11x}{6} = 66
     \]
     \[
     11x = 66 \times 6
     \]
     \[
     11x = 396
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{396}{11}
     \]
     \[
     x = 36
     \]

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Pins**:
   - Since \( x = 36 \), and John originally had two piles, he initially had:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 36 = 72
     \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,"Analyze the question carefully, evaluate each option in light of the provided information or principles, and select the response that most precisely aligns with the query's requirements.",3
"At noon, an experimenter has 50 grams of a radioactive isotope. At noon 9 days later only 45 grams remain. To the nearest day, how many days after the experiment started will there be only 20 grams?
(A) 54
(B) 59
(C) 60
(D) 78",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand radioactive decay and use the information given to determine the half-life of the isotope. Radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model.

Given:
- Initial amount at noon (day 0): \( A_0 = 50 \) grams.
- Amount after 9 days: \( A(9) = 45 \) grams.

The formula for radioactive decay is given by:

\[ A(t) = A_0 e^{-\lambda t} \]

where:
- \( A(t) \) is the amount of substance at time \( t \),
- \( A_0 \) is the initial amount,
- \( \lambda \) is the decay constant,
- \( t \) is the time elapsed.

First, we need to find the decay constant \(\lambda\). Using the information that 45 grams remain after 9 days:

\[ 45 = 50 e^{-\lambda \cdot 9} \]

Solving for \(\lambda\):

\[ \frac{45}{50} = e^{-9\lambda} \]
\[ 0.9 = e^{-9\lambda} \]
\[ \ln(0.9) = -9\lambda \]
\[ \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.9)}{9} \]

Using the natural logarithm:

\[ \lambda \approx -\frac{-0.10536}{9} \approx 0.0117 \text{ per day} \]

Now, we need to find the time \( t \) when only 20 grams remain:

\[ 20 = 50 e^{-0.0117t} \]

Solving for \( t \):

\[ \frac{20}{50} = e^{-0.0117t} \]
\[ 0.4 = e^{-0.0117t} \]
\[ \ln(0.4) = -0.0117t \]
\[ t = -\frac{\ln(0.4)}{0.0117} \]

Using the natural logarithm:

\[ t \approx -\frac{-0.9163}{0.0117} \approx 78 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, to the nearest day, it will take approximately 78 days for only 20 grams of the isotope to remain.

The correct answer is (D) 78.",1.0,"Analyze the question carefully, evaluate each option in light of the provided information or principles, and select the response that most precisely aligns with the query's requirements.",3
"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem, let's denote Noah's speed as \( N \) miles per hour.

Since Grady rides his bike \(60\%\) faster than Noah, Grady's speed can be expressed as:
\[ G = N + 0.6N = 1.6N \]

Given that both ride for two hours and Grady covers an additional 12 miles compared to Noah over this period, we can set up the following equations based on distance traveled:

- Distance covered by Noah in 2 hours: \( 2N \)
- Distance covered by Grady in 2 hours: \( 2G = 2(1.6N) = 3.2N \)

According to the problem, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah:
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

Thus, Noah rides at a speed of \( 10 \) miles per hour.

The correct answer is (C) 10.",1.0,"Analyze the question carefully, evaluate each option in light of the provided information or principles, and select the response that most precisely aligns with the query's requirements.",3
"This question refers to the following information.
""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.
That is why we must no longer lag behind.""

The reference to the ""continual beatings"" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?
(A) The invasion of Afghanistan
(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact
(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe
(D) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II",B,"The reference to ""continual beatings"" in Joseph Stalin's speech most directly supports the decision to create the Warsaw Pact (B). This option aligns with the historical context provided, which emphasizes the vulnerability and need for strength due to past exploitation. The Warsaw Pact was established as a counterbalance to NATO, reflecting a strategy aimed at preventing future ""beatings"" by forming a collective security arrangement among socialist states.

- **Option A: The invasion of Afghanistan** - While this event occurred later in Soviet history (1979), it is not directly supported by the historical context provided about past beatings and the need to avoid backwardness.
  
- **Option B: The creation of the Warsaw Pact** - This aligns well with the idea that the Soviet Union sought to prevent future ""beatings"" by forming a collective security arrangement, mirroring the historical narrative of being beaten due to backwardness.

- **Option C: The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe** - While this reflects a similar theme of asserting control and preventing perceived threats, it is more about internal Soviet influence rather than an external alliance for security.
  
- **Option D: The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II** - This event occurred earlier (1945) and was part of broader wartime alliances, not directly related to the historical context provided.

Therefore, the most precise answer is (B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact.",1.0,"Analyze the question carefully, evaluate each option in light of the provided information or principles, and select the response that most precisely aligns with the query's requirements.",3
"A corporation is ________ from its managers, employees, investors and customers. It therefore has _______ succession and also ________.
(A) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets
(B) Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets
(C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets
(D) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets",C,"The correct answer is (C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets.

Let's break down the options:

- **Independent**: A corporation operates independently of its managers, employees, investors, and customers. This means that these groups can change without affecting the ongoing operations of the corporation.
  
- **Perpetual**: Corporations are typically structured in a way that allows them to continue indefinitely unless they dissolve or are liquidated. This is often referred to as having perpetual succession.

- **Owns its own assets**: A corporation is considered an entity distinct from its owners (shareholders), and it can acquire, hold, and dispose of property in its own name.

Option (A) ""Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets"" does not fit because a corporation is distinguishable from its stakeholders and typically owns its assets.

Option (B) ""Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets"" has the correct ownership aspect but uses the term ""Limited,"" which refers to limited liability rather than perpetual succession.

Option (D) ""Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets"" incorrectly states that a corporation is indistinguishable from its stakeholders, whereas it is distinct and independent.

Therefore, option (C) accurately describes the nature of a corporation.",1.0,"Analyze the question carefully, evaluate each option in light of the provided information or principles, and select the response that most precisely aligns with the query's requirements.",3
