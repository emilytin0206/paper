"At noon, an experimenter has 50 grams of a radioactive isotope. At noon 9 days later only 45 grams remain. To the nearest day, how many days after the experiment started will there be only 20 grams?
(A) 54
(B) 59
(C) 60
(D) 78",D,"To solve this problem, we need to understand radioactive decay and use the given information to determine the half-life of the isotope. Radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model.

Given:
- Initial amount \( A_0 = 50 \) grams.
- Amount after 9 days \( A(9) = 45 \) grams.

The formula for radioactive decay is:

\[ A(t) = A_0 e^{-\lambda t} \]

where:
- \( A(t) \) is the amount of substance at time \( t \),
- \( A_0 \) is the initial amount,
- \( \lambda \) is the decay constant,
- \( t \) is the time elapsed.

First, we need to find the decay constant \(\lambda\). Using the information given:

\[ 45 = 50 e^{-9\lambda} \]

Solving for \(\lambda\):

1. Divide both sides by 50:
   \[ \frac{45}{50} = e^{-9\lambda} \]
   \[ 0.9 = e^{-9\lambda} \]

2. Take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for \(\lambda\):
   \[ \ln(0.9) = -9\lambda \]
   \[ \lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.9)}{9} \]

Using a calculator:
\[ \lambda \approx 0.0124573 \text{ per day} \]

Next, we need to find the time \( t \) when only 20 grams remain:

\[ 20 = 50 e^{-\lambda t} \]

Solving for \( t \):

1. Divide both sides by 50:
   \[ \frac{20}{50} = e^{-\lambda t} \]
   \[ 0.4 = e^{-\lambda t} \]

2. Take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for \( t \):
   \[ \ln(0.4) = -\lambda t \]
   \[ t = -\frac{\ln(0.4)}{\lambda} \]

Using a calculator:
\[ t \approx -\frac{\ln(0.4)}{0.0124573} \]
\[ t \approx 69.6 \text{ days} \]

Rounding to the nearest day, we get \( t \approx 70 \) days.

However, since none of the given options match exactly 70 days, we need to choose the closest option:

(A) 54
(B) 59
(C) 60
(D) 78

The closest value is (D) 78 days. Therefore, the most accurate solution based on the provided options is:

"This question refers to the following information.
""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.
That is why we must no longer lag behind.""
Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931
The reference to the ""continual beatings"" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?
(A) The invasion of Afghanistan
(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact
(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe
(D) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II",B,"To analyze this question, we need to understand the context provided by Joseph Stalin's speech. He emphasizes the historical pattern where backwardness leads to being beaten and exploited by more powerful nations. This theme is central to his argument for not falling behind.

Let's examine each option:

(A) The invasion of Afghanistan: While this was a significant event in Soviet history, it occurred much later (1979), after Stalin’s time. It does not directly align with the historical context provided by Stalin about backwardness leading to being beaten.

(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact: This happened in 1955, following World War II and shortly after Stalin's death. The Warsaw Pact was a response to perceived threats from NATO and aimed at ensuring mutual defense among socialist states. It aligns with the idea that the Soviet Union needed to strengthen its position against potential exploitation by more powerful nations.

(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine: This doctrine was formulated in 1968, during Brezhnev's leadership, as a response to the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia. It emphasized the need for socialist countries to maintain their communist systems and could be seen as an extension of Stalin’s idea that backwardness leads to exploitation.

(D) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II: This occurred in 1945, during World War II, when the Soviet Union was already a major power. It does not fit the context of being beaten due to backwardness as it happened before Stalin's speech and the historical pattern he described.

Given this analysis, the most accurate answer is:

(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact

This decision directly reflects the idea that the Soviet Union needed to avoid falling behind and being exploited by more powerful nations.",0.0,Analyze each option carefully and eliminate incorrect answers until you find the most accurate solution.,1
"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pins John originally had.

1. **Define Variables and Understand the Problem:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
   - Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he originally had \( 2x \) pins.
   - He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. So, he gave away \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \times x = \frac{x}{6}\).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - After giving away \(\frac{x}{6}\) pins, John had \( 2x - \frac{x}{6} \) pins left.
   - According to the problem, he had 66 pins left after giving some away.

3. **Formulate and Solve the Equation:**
   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
   \]
   To solve this equation, first find a common denominator for the terms involving \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = 66
   \]
   Combine the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{11x}{6} = 66
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   11x = 396
   \]
   Divide both sides by 11:
   \[
   x = 36
   \]

4. **Calculate the Original Number of Pins:**
   - Since \( x \) is the number of pins in one pile, and John originally had two piles, he originally had \( 2x = 2 \times 36 = 72 \) pins.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,Analyze each option carefully and eliminate incorrect answers until you find the most accurate solution.,1
"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem, let's denote Noah's speed as \( N \) miles per hour.

Since Grady rides his bike \(60\%\) faster than Noah, Grady's speed can be expressed as:
\[ G = N + 0.6N = 1.6N \]

Next, we know that in two hours, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah. We can express the distances each of them travels in two hours using their speeds:

- Distance traveled by Noah in two hours: \( 2N \)
- Distance traveled by Grady in two hours: \( 2G = 2(1.6N) = 3.2N \)

According to the problem, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah:
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

So, Noah rides at a speed of \( 10 \) miles per hour.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 10.",1.0,Analyze each option carefully and eliminate incorrect answers until you find the most accurate solution.,1
"A corporation is ________ from its managers, employees, investors and customers. It therefore has _______ succession and also ________.
(A) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets
(B) Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets
(C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets
(D) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets",C,"Let's analyze each part of the sentence carefully:

1. **""A corporation is ________ from its managers, employees, investors and customers.""**
   - The term that best fits here is ""Independent"". A corporation operates as a separate legal entity distinct from its stakeholders.

2. **""It therefore has _______ succession and also ________.""**
   - ""Perpetual succession"" means the corporation can continue to exist even if all of its original owners or managers leave.
   - The phrase ""also ________"" likely refers to another characteristic of a corporation, which is that it owns its own assets.

Now let's match these with the given options:

(A) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Does not own its own assets
- This option does not fit because corporations are distinguishable from their stakeholders and they do own their own assets.

(B) Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets
- This option fits well as it correctly states that a corporation is independent, has perpetual succession (limited liability), and owns its own assets.

(C) Independent, Perpetual, Owns its own assets
- While this option correctly identifies independence and perpetual succession, it incorrectly states that the corporation does not own its own assets. This is incorrect because corporations do indeed own their own assets.

(D) Indistinguishable, Perpetual, Owns its own assets
- This option incorrectly uses ""Indistinguishable"" instead of ""Independent"". It also correctly identifies perpetual succession and ownership of assets.

Given this analysis, the most accurate solution is:

**(B) Independent, Limited, Owns its own assets**

This accurately describes a corporation's characteristics.",0.0,Analyze each option carefully and eliminate incorrect answers until you find the most accurate solution.,1
