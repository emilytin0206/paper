"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
2. Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he originally had \( 2x \) pins.
3. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. One-third of one pile is \( \frac{x}{3} \), and half of that is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{3} = \frac{x}{6} \).
4. After giving away \( \frac{x}{6} \) pins, John had 66 pins left.
5. The number of pins he originally had minus the number of pins he gave away equals the number of pins he has left:
   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
   \]
6. To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms by finding a common denominator:
   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{11x}{6}
   \]
7. Set the equation equal to 66 and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{11x}{6} = 66
   \]
8. Multiply both sides by 6:
   \[
   11x = 396
   \]
9. Divide both sides by 11:
   \[
   x = 36
   \]

Since \( x \) is the number of pins in one pile, and John originally had two piles, he originally had \( 2x = 2 \times 36 = 72 \) pins.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,Answer the question directly.,0
"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"Let's denote Noah's speed as \(N\) miles per hour.

Since Grady rides his bike \(60\%\) faster than Noah, Grady's speed is \(N + 0.6N = 1.6N\) miles per hour.

In two hours:
- Noah travels a distance of \(2N\) miles.
- Grady travels a distance of \(2 \times 1.6N = 3.2N\) miles.

According to the problem, Grady rides \(12\) miles further than Noah in these two hours. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[3.2N - 2N = 12\]

Simplifying this gives us:
\[1.2N = 12\]

Dividing both sides by \(1.2\):
\[N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10\]

So, Noah rides at a speed of \(10\) miles per hour.

The correct answer is (C) 10.",1.0,Answer the question directly.,0
