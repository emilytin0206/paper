"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps and use the information given.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( N \) be Noah's speed in miles per hour.
   - Grady rides 60% faster than Noah, so Grady's speed is \( 1.6N \).

2. **Distance Traveled by Each in Two Hours:**
   - Distance traveled = Speed × Time
   - Noah travels \( N \times 2 \) miles in two hours.
   - Grady travels \( 1.6N \times 2 \) miles in two hours.

3. **Set Up the Equation Based on Given Information:**
   - According to the problem, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah in two hours.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     1.6N \times 2 = N \times 2 + 12
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( N \):**
   - Simplify both sides of the equation:
     \[
     3.2N = 2N + 12
     \]
   - Subtract \( 2N \) from both sides to isolate terms involving \( N \):
     \[
     3.2N - 2N = 12
     \]
     \[
     1.2N = 12
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 1.2:
     \[
     N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Noah rides at a speed of \( 10 \) miles per hour.

Thus, the correct answer is (C) 10.",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, identify key elements, break down the problem into smaller steps, solve each step methodically, and provide a clear final answer.",3
"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the key elements of the question**:
   - John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles.
   - He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.
   - After giving some pins to his brother, John had 66 pins left.

2. **Define variables and set up equations**:
   Let \( x \) be the number of pins in each pile before any were given away. Since there are two equal piles, the total number of pins John originally had is \( 2x \).

3. **Calculate how many pins John gave to his brother**:
   - One-third of one pile: \( \frac{x}{3} \)
   - Half of that amount: \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{3} = \frac{x}{6} \)

4. **Set up the equation for the remaining pins**:
   John had 66 pins left after giving away \( \frac{x}{6} \) pins from one pile. Therefore, we can write the equation as follows:

   \[
   x + x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
   \]

5. **Simplify and solve for \( x \)**:
   Combine like terms on the left side of the equation:

   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
   \]

   To combine these, find a common denominator (which is 6):

   \[
   \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = 66
   \]

   Simplify the left side:

   \[
   \frac{11x}{6} = 66
   \]

   Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:

   \[
   11x = 396
   \]

   Divide both sides by 11:

   \[
   x = 36
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of pins John originally had**:
   Since \( x \) is the number of pins in one pile, and there are two piles, the total number of pins John originally had is:

   \[
   2x = 2 \times 36 = 72
   \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, identify key elements, break down the problem into smaller steps, solve each step methodically, and provide a clear final answer.",3
