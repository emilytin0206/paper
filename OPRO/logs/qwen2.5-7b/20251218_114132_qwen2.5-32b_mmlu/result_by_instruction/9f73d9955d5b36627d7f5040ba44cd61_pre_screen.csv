"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem systematically, we will follow these steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables and Understand the Problem

Let \( N \) be Noah's speed in miles per hour.

Since Grady rides his bike \(60\%\) faster than Noah:
- Grady's speed = \( N + 0.6N = 1.6N \)

We know that in two hours, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation

In two hours:
- Distance traveled by Noah = \( 2N \)
- Distance traveled by Grady = \( 2 \times 1.6N = 3.2N \)

According to the problem, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah in these two hours:
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( N \)

Simplify the equation:
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]

Divide both sides by 1.2 to solve for \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10 \]

So, Noah rides at a speed of \( 10 \) miles per hour.

### Step 4: Verify the Solution

- Noah's speed: \( N = 10 \) mph
- Grady's speed: \( 1.6N = 1.6 \times 10 = 16 \) mph

In two hours:
- Distance traveled by Noah: \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) miles
- Distance traveled by Grady: \( 2 \times 16 = 32 \) miles

Difference in distance:
\[ 32 - 20 = 12 \] miles, which matches the problem statement.

Thus, the solution is verified to be correct.

### Final Answer:

Noah rides at a speed of \(\boxed{10}\) miles per hour.",0.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, identify key components, solve systematically in steps, and verify the solution for accuracy.",3
"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the key components of the question**:
   - John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles.
   - He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.
   - After giving some pins to his brother, John had 66 pins left.

2. **Define variables and set up equations**:
   Let \( x \) be the number of pins in each pile before any were given away. Since there are two equal piles, the total number of pins John originally had is \( 2x \).

3. **Calculate how many pins John gave to his brother**:
   - One-third of one pile: \(\frac{x}{3}\)
   - Half of that amount: \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{3} = \frac{x}{6}\)

4. **Set up the equation for the remaining pins**:
   John had \( 2x \) pins initially and gave away \(\frac{x}{6}\) pins, so he has \( 2x - \frac{x}{6} \) pins left.
   
5. **Simplify the expression for the remaining pins**:
   To simplify \( 2x - \frac{x}{6} \), we need a common denominator:
   \[
   2x = \frac{12x}{6}
   \]
   So,
   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{11x}{6}
   \]

6. **Set the remaining pins equal to 66 and solve for \( x \)**:
   According to the problem, John had 66 pins left after giving some away.
   \[
   \frac{11x}{6} = 66
   \]
   To find \( x \), multiply both sides by 6:
   \[
   11x = 396
   \]
   Then divide by 11:
   \[
   x = 36
   \]

7. **Calculate the total number of pins John originally had**:
   Since \( x \) is the number of pins in each pile, and there are two piles,
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 36 = 72
   \]

8. **Verify the solution**:
   - Each pile initially has 36 pins.
   - John gives his brother one-half of one-third of one pile: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{36}{3} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6
     \]
   - After giving away 6 pins, he has:
     \[
     72 - 6 = 66
     \]

The solution is verified to be correct. Therefore, the number of pins John originally had is \( \boxed{72} \).",0.0,"Analyze the question thoroughly, identify key components, solve systematically in steps, and verify the solution for accuracy.",3
