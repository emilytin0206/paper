"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the Variables and Understand the Problem:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
   - Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he originally had \( 2x \) pins.
   - He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. This means he gave away \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \times x = \frac{x}{6}\).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - After giving away \(\frac{x}{6}\) pins, John had \( 2x - \frac{x}{6} \) pins left.
   - According to the problem, he had 66 pins left after giving some away.

3. **Formulate and Solve the Equation:**
   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
   \]
   To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms by finding a common denominator:
   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{11x}{6}
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{11x}{6} = 66
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   11x = 396
   \]
   Divide both sides by 11:
   \[
   x = 36
   \]

4. **Calculate the Original Number of Pins:**
   - Since \( x \) is the number of pins in one pile, and John originally had two piles, he originally had \( 2x \):
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 36 = 72
   \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,"Analyze the problem in detail, divide it into simpler components, solve each component systematically, and compile the results for a clear, accurate final answer.",3
"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem, we will break it down into simpler components and solve each step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( N \) be the speed of Noah in miles per hour (mph).

Since Grady rides his bike 60% faster than Noah:
- Grady's speed is \( N + 0.6N = 1.6N \) mph.

### Step 2: Set Up Distance Equations
Both Grady and Noah ride for 2 hours. The distance each covers can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

- Distance covered by Noah in 2 hours: \( 2N \) miles.
- Distance covered by Grady in 2 hours: \( 2 \times 1.6N = 3.2N \) miles.

### Step 3: Use the Given Information
According to the problem, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah:
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( N \)
Simplify the equation:
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]
Divide both sides by 1.2:
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10 \]

So, Noah rides at a speed of \( 10 \) mph.

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
- Noah's speed: \( 10 \) mph.
- Grady's speed: \( 1.6 \times 10 = 16 \) mph.
- Distance covered by Noah in 2 hours: \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) miles.
- Distance covered by Grady in 2 hours: \( 2 \times 16 = 32 \) miles.

The difference is:
\[ 32 - 20 = 12 \] miles, which matches the given information.

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{C}
