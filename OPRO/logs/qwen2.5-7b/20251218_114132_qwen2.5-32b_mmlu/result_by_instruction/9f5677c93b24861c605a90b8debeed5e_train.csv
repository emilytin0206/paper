"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the key components of the problem**:
   - John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles.
   - He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.
   - After giving some pins to his brother, John had 66 pins left.

2. **Define variables and set up equations**:
   Let \( x \) be the number of pins in each pile before any were given away. Since there are two equal piles, the total number of pins John originally had is \( 2x \).

3. **Calculate how many pins John gave to his brother**:
   - One-third of one pile: \(\frac{x}{3}\)
   - Half of that amount: \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{3} = \frac{x}{6}\)

4. **Determine the number of pins left after giving some to his brother**:
   - Pins given away: \( \frac{x}{6} \)
   - Pins remaining: \( 2x - \frac{x}{6} \)

5. **Set up an equation based on the information that John had 66 pins left**:
   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To solve this equation, first find a common denominator to combine the terms on the left side:
   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{11x}{6}
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{11x}{6} = 66
   \]

7. **Isolate \( x \)** by multiplying both sides of the equation by 6:
   \[
   11x = 396
   \]

8. **Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 11**:
   \[
   x = \frac{396}{11} = 36
   \]

9. **Calculate the total number of pins John originally had**:
   Since each pile has \( x \) pins and there are two piles, the total number of pins is:
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 36 = 72
   \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,"Analyze the problem carefully, identify key components, and solve systematically to ensure precision in your final answer.",3
"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem systematically, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( N \) be the speed of Noah in miles per hour.

Since Grady rides his bike \(60\%\) faster than Noah:
\[ G = N + 0.6N = 1.6N \]

### Step 2: Set Up Distance Equations
Both Grady and Noah ride for 2 hours. The distance each covers can be calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

For Noah:
\[ D_N = N \times 2 \]
For Grady:
\[ D_G = G \times 2 = 1.6N \times 2 = 3.2N \]

### Step 3: Use the Given Information
According to the problem, Grady rides \(12\) miles further than Noah in two hours:
\[ D_G = D_N + 12 \]
Substitute the expressions for \(D_G\) and \(D_N\):
\[ 3.2N = 2N + 12 \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( N \)
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( N \):
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]
Divide both sides by 1.2:
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10 \]

### Conclusion
Noah rides at a speed of \(10\) miles per hour.

Thus, the correct answer is (C) 10.",1.0,"Analyze the problem carefully, identify key components, and solve systematically to ensure precision in your final answer.",3
