"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem, we will follow the steps of analyzing the problem deeply, decomposing it into simpler components, solving each component systematically, and combining the results for an accurate and clear final answer.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( N \) be Noah's speed in miles per hour.
   - Grady rides 60% faster than Noah, so Grady's speed is \( 1.6N \).

2. **Distance Traveled by Each in Two Hours:**
   - Distance traveled by Noah in two hours = \( 2N \) miles.
   - Distance traveled by Grady in two hours = \( 2 \times 1.6N = 3.2N \) miles.

3. **Given Information:**
   - Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah in two hours.
   - Therefore, the difference in distance is given by:
     \[
     3.2N - 2N = 12
     \]

4. **Solve for \( N \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     1.2N = 12
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 1.2 to solve for \( N \):
     \[
     N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10
     \]

### Conclusion:

Noah rides at a speed of \( 10 \) miles per hour.

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{C}

"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the Variables and Understand the Problem:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
   - Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he originally had \( 2x \) pins.
   - He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. This means he gave away \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \times x = \frac{x}{6}\).

2. **Set Up the Equation Based on What's Left:**
   - After giving away \(\frac{x}{6}\) pins, John had \( 2x - \frac{x}{6} \) pins left.
   - According to the problem, he had 66 pins left after giving some away.

3. **Formulate and Solve the Equation:**
   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
   \]
   To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms by finding a common denominator:
   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{11x}{6}
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{11x}{6} = 66
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   11x = 396
   \]
   Divide both sides by 11:
   \[
   x = 36
   \]

4. **Calculate the Original Number of Pins:**
   - Since \( x \) is the number of pins in one pile, and John originally had two piles, he originally had \( 2x = 2 \times 36 = 72 \) pins.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,"Analyze the problem deeply, decompose it into simpler components, solve each component systematically, and combine the results for an accurate and clear final answer.",3
