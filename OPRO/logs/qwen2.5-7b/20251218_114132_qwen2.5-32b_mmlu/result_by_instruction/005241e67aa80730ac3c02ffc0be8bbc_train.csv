"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( N \) be the speed of Noah in miles per hour.
- Since Grady rides his bike 60% faster than Noah, Grady's speed is \( 1.6N \) miles per hour.

Next, we know that both ride for 2 hours. Therefore, the distance each covers can be calculated as:
- Distance covered by Noah in 2 hours: \( 2N \)
- Distance covered by Grady in 2 hours: \( 2 \times 1.6N = 3.2N \)

According to the problem, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah in two hours. So we can set up the following equation:
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]

Now, solve for \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10 \]

So, Noah rides at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) 10.",1.0,Let's think step by step.,0
"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many pins John originally had.

1. **Define Variables and Understand the Problem:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
   - Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he initially has \( 2x \) pins in total.
   - He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. This means he gave away \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \times x = \frac{x}{6}\).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - After giving away \(\frac{x}{6}\) pins, John had 66 pins left.
   - Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:
     \[
     2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - First, find a common denominator to combine the terms on the left side of the equation. The common denominator for 2 and 6 is 6.
     \[
     2x = \frac{12x}{6}
     \]
   - Substitute this into the equation:
     \[
     \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = 66
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{12x - x}{6} = 66
     \]
     \[
     \frac{11x}{6} = 66
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     11x = 396
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 11:
     \[
     x = 36
     \]

4. **Find the Total Number of Pins:**
   - Since \( x \) is the number of pins in one pile, and John had two piles initially, he originally had:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 36 = 72
     \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,Let's think step by step.,0
