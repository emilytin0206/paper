"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem methodically, let's break it down into steps:

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let \( N \) be the speed of Noah in miles per hour.

Since Grady rides his bike \(60\%\) faster than Noah:
- Grady’s speed is \( N + 0.6N = 1.6N \).

### Step 2: Set Up Distance Equations
Both Grady and Noah ride for the same amount of time, which is 2 hours.

The distance traveled by Noah in 2 hours is:
\[ D_{\text{Noah}} = N \times 2 \]

The distance traveled by Grady in 2 hours is:
\[ D_{\text{Grady}} = 1.6N \times 2 \]

### Step 3: Use the Given Information
According to the problem, Grady rides \(12\) miles further than Noah in two hours.

So we can write the equation:
\[ D_{\text{Grady}} - D_{\text{Noah}} = 12 \]

Substitute the distances from Step 2 into this equation:
\[ (1.6N \times 2) - (N \times 2) = 12 \]

### Step 4: Simplify and Solve for \( N \)
Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]

Now, solve for \( N \):
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} \]
\[ N = 10 \]

### Conclusion
Noah rides at a speed of \( 10 \) miles per hour.

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[

"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the Variables and Understand the Problem:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
   - Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he originally had \( 2x \) pins.
   - He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. This means he gave away \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \times x = \frac{x}{6}\).

2. **Set Up the Equation Based on What's Left:**
   - After giving away \(\frac{x}{6}\) pins, John had \( 2x - \frac{x}{6} \) pins left.
   - According to the problem, he had 66 pins left after giving some to his brother. So we can write:
     \[
     2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To solve this equation, first find a common denominator for the terms on the left side of the equation. The common denominator is 6.
     \[
     2x - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{11x}{6}
     \]
   - Now, set this equal to 66:
     \[
     \frac{11x}{6} = 66
     \]
   - To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides by 6:
     \[
     11x = 396
     \]
   - Finally, divide both sides by 11:
     \[
     x = 36
     \]

4. **Find the Original Number of Pins:**
   - Since \( x \) is the number of pins in one pile and John originally had two piles, he originally had \( 2x \):
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 36 = 72
     \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,"Analyze the problem carefully, break it down into manageable steps, and solve methodically for an accurate answer.",2
