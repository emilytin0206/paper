"This question refers to the following information.
""To slacken the tempo would mean falling behind. And those who fall behind get beaten. But we do not want to be beaten. No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: ""You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia."" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: ""You are abundant,"" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: ""You are poor and impotent,"" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.
That is why we must no longer lag behind.""
Joseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931
The reference to the ""continual beatings"" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?
(A) The invasion of Afghanistan
(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact
(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe
(D) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II",B,"To answer this question, let's break down the information and analyze each option step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: Joseph Stalin's speech emphasizes the historical pattern where backwardness leads to being beaten or exploited. This idea is central to understanding how later Soviet foreign policy decisions might be influenced by a desire not to fall behind or be vulnerable to external pressures.

2. **Analyzing Each Option**:
   - **(A) The invasion of Afghanistan**: While this was a significant event in Soviet history, it occurred much later (1979), and the speech from 1931 would have had little direct influence on such a decision.
   - **(B) The creation of the Warsaw Pact**: This was established in 1955 as a response to NATO's formation. It aligns with the idea of not wanting to be beaten or isolated, but it came after Stalin’s speech and might reflect a broader Cold War strategy rather than directly stemming from the historical context provided.
   - **(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe**: This doctrine was articulated by Leonid Brezhnev in 1968, during the Prague Spring. It reflects a desire to prevent any perceived threat to Soviet influence and control within its sphere of influence, which aligns with the historical context of not wanting to be beaten or exploited.
   - **(D) The declaration of war against Japan at the end of World War II**: This occurred in 1945, well before Stalin's speech. It was a strategic decision based on broader geopolitical considerations rather than the specific historical context provided.

3. **Conclusion**:
Given that option (C) directly reflects the idea of not wanting to be beaten or exploited and aligns with the historical context of Soviet foreign policy decisions aimed at maintaining control over its sphere of influence, it is the most appropriate answer.

Therefore, the reference to ""continual beatings"" most directly supports **(C) The imposition of the Brezhnev Doctrine against anti-Soviet protesters in Europe**.",0.0,Let's think step by step.,3
