"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given and then solve for Noah's speed.

Let's denote:
- \( N \) as Noah's speed in miles per hour.
- Since Grady rides \(60\%\) faster than Noah, Grady's speed is \(1.6N\) (because \(60\% = 0.6\), and adding this to Noah's speed gives us \(N + 0.6N = 1.6N\)).

Given that both ride for two hours:
- The distance Noah rides in two hours is \(2N\).
- The distance Grady rides in two hours is \(2 \times 1.6N = 3.2N\).

According to the problem, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah in these two hours. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]

To find \( N \), divide both sides by 1.2:
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10 \]

So, Noah rides at a speed of \(10\) miles per hour.

"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the Variables and Initial Setup**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
   - Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he originally had \( 2x \) pins.

2. **Determine How Many Pins Were Given Away**:
   - John gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile.
   - One-third of one pile is \( \frac{x}{3} \).
   - Half of that amount is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{3} = \frac{x}{6} \).

3. **Calculate the Remaining Pins**:
   - John had 66 pins left after giving away some.
   - The number of pins given away plus the remaining pins equals the original total: \( x + x = 2x \).
   - Therefore, the equation for the remaining pins is: 
     \[
     2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation**:
   - To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms by finding a common denominator:
     \[
     2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
     \]
     Convert \( 2x \) to have a denominator of 6:
     \[
     \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = 66
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{12x - x}{6} = 66
     \]
     Simplify the numerator:
     \[
     \frac{11x}{6} = 66
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     11x = 396
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 11:
     \[
     x = 36
     \]

5. **Determine the Original Number of Pins**:
   - Since \( x \) is the number of pins in one pile, and John originally had two piles:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 36 = 72
     \]

Therefore, the original number of pins John had was **(B) 72**.",0.0,Provide a detailed answer.,0
