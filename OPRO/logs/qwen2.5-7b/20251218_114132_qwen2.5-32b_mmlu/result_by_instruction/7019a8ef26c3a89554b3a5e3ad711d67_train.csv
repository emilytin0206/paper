"Grady rides his bike $60\%$ faster than his little brother Noah. If Grady rides $12$ miles further than Noah in two hours, how fast in miles per hour does Noah ride?
(A) 32
(B) 20
(C) 10
(D) 7.2",C,"To solve this problem, let's denote Noah's speed as \( N \) miles per hour.

Since Grady rides his bike \(60\%\) faster than Noah, Grady's speed can be expressed as:
\[ G = N + 0.6N = 1.6N \]

Next, we know that in two hours, Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah. We can express the distance each of them travels in two hours using their speeds:

- Distance traveled by Noah in two hours: \( 2N \)
- Distance traveled by Grady in two hours: \( 2G = 2(1.6N) = 3.2N \)

According to the problem, Grady rides 12 miles more than Noah:
\[ 3.2N - 2N = 12 \]

Simplifying this equation:
\[ 1.2N = 12 \]

To find \( N \), we divide both sides by 1.2:
\[ N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10 \]

Therefore, Noah rides at a speed of \( 10 \) miles per hour.

"John divided his souvenir hat pins into two piles. The two piles had an equal number of pins. He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. John had 66 pins left. How many pins did John originally have?
(A) 396
(B) 72
(C) 66
(D) 36",B,"Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables and Understand the Problem:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pins in one pile.
   - Since John divided his souvenir hat pins into two equal piles, he originally had \( 2x \) pins.
   - He gave his brother one-half of one-third of one pile. This means he gave away \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \times x = \frac{x}{6}\).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - After giving away \(\frac{x}{6}\) pins, John had \( 2x - \frac{x}{6} \) pins left.
   - According to the problem, he had 66 pins left after giving some away.

3. **Formulate and Solve the Equation:**
   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = 66
   \]
   To solve for \( x \), first combine like terms by finding a common denominator:
   \[
   2x - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{12x}{6} - \frac{x}{6} = \frac{11x}{6}
   \]
   So the equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{11x}{6} = 66
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   11x = 396
   \]
   Divide both sides by 11:
   \[
   x = 36
   \]

5. **Find the Original Number of Pins:**
   Since \( x \) is the number of pins in one pile, and John originally had two piles:
   \[
   2x = 2 \times 36 = 72
   \]

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) 72.",1.0,Solve this problem carefully.,0
