- Include section headers such as Objectives, Context, Definitions, Principles/Methodologies, Steps, Evidence, Evaluation Criteria, Conclusions, Procedural Requirements, Pertinent Factors.

[Thinking Steps]
1. Identify and clarify primary goals.
2. Provide necessary context or background information upfront for analysis.
3. Apply a structured method to analyze the problem by breaking down tasks into distinct, actionable steps with a logical sequence.
4. Gather all necessary data and credible sources for comprehensive analysis.
5. Organize analysis into logical segments addressing key factors using verifiable facts and specific evidence.
6. Ensure systematic application throughout the response.
7. Justify decisions with concrete examples and Chain-of-Thought rationale.
8. Conduct intermediate steps with clear analysis and verification against established principles.
9. Verify conclusions are supported by specific evidence, quotes, and data from credible sources.

[Do's]
- Define clear objectives and criteria for success at the outset.
- Provide necessary context or background information upfront for analysis.
- Use precise terminology for key parameters and concepts.
- Ensure responses are structured logically with distinct segments.
- Integrate all provided information into the response systematically.
- Support arguments with verifiable data or concrete evidence from credible sources.
- Specify measurable criteria necessary to achieve the objective.
- Define terms at the beginning and apply them directly to the context.
- Simplify explanations by focusing on direct relationships without unnecessary complexity.
- Verify conclusions with established principles throughout the process.
- Link theory to practical application through purpose statements.
- Ensure precision in scope and avoid overly broad topics.
- Use a structured analytical approach without introducing unrelated topics.
- Direct prompts towards selecting the correct answer from given options.

[Don'ts]
- Avoid vague or ambiguous language and instructions.
- Do not skip critical steps, sub-steps, variables, or components in the solution.
- Refrain from omitting essential details extracted from the text.
- Ensure thorough documentation at every stage without unnecessary complexity.
- Avoid unsupported claims; ensure all conclusions are backed by evidence.
- Present a complete and coherent response with systematic evaluations at each step.
- Do not generalize findings without textual support.
- Avoid vague or unclear identification of essential aspects.
- Refrain from asking for unsupported or speculative conclusions.
- Do not omit verification of calculations or unit consistency.
- Avoid ambiguity or undefined terms.
- Ensure tasks and outcomes are clearly defined.
- Avoid providing unnecessary details that do not contribute to the core issue or task.
- Do not make assumptions without justifying them based on relevant principles or standards.
