[Key Vocabulary]
analyze, reason, justify, detailed process, conclude, clarity, precision, specific actions, clear outcome, completeness, logical breakdown, systematic verification, precise matching, step-by-step reasoning, comprehensive analysis, core principles, structured thinking, key elements, components, conclusions, systematic approach, clear findings, breakdown, logical progression, thorough analysis, definitive conclusion, structured reasoning, precise language, context-based comparison, actionable steps, logical sequence of steps

[Structural Elements]
Use Markdown for formatting (e.g., headers, lists). Include section headers to outline logical steps and a final conclusion or answer section. Use bullet points or numbered lists for step-by-step instructions.

[Thinking Steps]
1. Define the specific scope, criteria, context, and goal of the task.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts (components).
3. Analyze each part thoroughly with detailed explanations at each stage of the process.
4. Justify steps based on understanding of specific meanings and relationships within the given context.
5. Ensure logical progression towards the answer with step-by-step reasoning and comprehensive explanations.
6. Identify core issues and apply analytical evaluation to derive conclusions.
7. Synthesize findings and provide a clear conclusion based on thorough analysis.

[Do's]
- Be specific about the desired outcome and include actionable steps or instructions.
- Define clear criteria, context, and scope for analysis.
- Require detailed breakdowns, comprehensive explanations, and justifications for each step.
- Use systematic step-by-step reasoning to guide through the task.
- Ensure responses are coherent, well-supported, and aligned with relevant principles.
- Specify a clear, actionable goal with an expected outcome.
- Outline the required structure or components of the response.
- Focus on evaluating specific components methodically.
- Provide thorough analysis.
- Include precise criteria and necessary elements.
- Guide through logical steps without ambiguity.
- Incorporate context-based comparison to support reasoning.

[Don'ts]
- Avoid vague statements that do not specify actions or criteria.
- Do not skip any component of the analysis or reasoning process.
- Provide final answers without thorough analysis and supporting explanations.
- Omit specific details from given material or necessary variables/conditions.
- Use vague or ambiguous language in instructions or prompts.
- Exclude steps in logical progression or omit clear findings aligned with relevant principles.
- Avoid vague instructions.
- Do not leave room for ambiguity in the prompt.
- Refrain from general statements and non-actionable instructions.
