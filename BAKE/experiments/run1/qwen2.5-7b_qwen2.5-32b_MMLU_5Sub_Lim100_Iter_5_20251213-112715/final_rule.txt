2. Break down the problem into fundamental components systematically.
3. Synthesize relevant information from the provided context to form key points.
4. Conduct a thorough, precise analysis using substantiated evidence (e.g., empirical data, case studies, industry research) and detailed explanations.
5. Make explicit selections based on logical reasoning, domain-specific principles, or data/evidence.
6. Provide clear logical connections between steps and ensure clarity in reasoning.
7. Justify conclusions with relevant principles or laws, ensuring claims are supported by references or concrete examples.
8. Verify findings rigorously by linking evidence directly to conclusions.
9. Derive a precise conclusion based on applicable principles and comprehensive analysis.
