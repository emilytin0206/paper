[Structural Elements]
- Use Markdown for formatting (e.g., headers, lists).
- Include section headers such as "Introduction", "Task Definition", "Analysis Steps", "Detailed Explanation", and "Conclusion".
- Use step-by-step headers (e.g., "Step 1:", "Step 2:") and bullet points where appropriate.
- Ensure explicit labeling of final answers or conclusions using a distinct format (e.g., bold text).
- Clearly define the task, break it down into steps if necessary, specify the desired outcome or format.

[Thinking Steps]
1. Clarify the Task: Define and state the task to be performed, including context and detailed instructions.
2. Break Down the Problem: Systematically analyze each component of the problem with methodical reasoning, referencing core principles where relevant.
3. Conduct Detailed Analysis: Ensure each step is logically connected and systematically analyzed, providing detailed explanations for each component or outcome using chain-of-thought reasoning.
4. Synthesize Findings: Combine insights from various sources or steps to form a cohesive conclusion based on thorough analysis and comparison.
5. Verify Conclusions: Rigorously verify conclusions against provided information and consider counterexamples or edge cases before reaching a clear final conclusion.

[Do's]
- Directly address the task using specific concepts or logical reasoning, specifying precise actions such as identify, evaluate, define.
- Specify clear actions using precise verbs (e.g., "solve", "explain", "derive").
- Provide detailed explanations for each step, ensuring clarity in explaining specific components or outcomes.
- Break down tasks into manageable parts with systematic analysis and comprehensive evaluations.
- Include context-specific instructions that guide the reasoning process.
- Use section headers to organize content logically, including bullet points or numbered lists where appropriate.
- Show all intermediate calculations before reaching a conclusion.
- Ensure explicit conclusions based on provided reasoning processes.
- Incorporate consideration of ethical implications and potential harm within societal or situational contexts.
- Provide justification based on relevant context.

[Don'ts]
- Avoid vague or ambiguous terms that can lead to confusion.
- Refrain from skipping necessary contextual information crucial for comprehension.
- Do not omit detailed explanations when required, avoiding general directions without specificity.
- Omit theoretical frameworks or principles where they are relevant.
- Provide only the final answer without detailed reasoning.
- Include unnecessary or irrelevant information.
- Leave any ambiguity in the instructions or final action required.
- Avoid vague or incomplete explanations, refraining from presenting a conclusion without rigorous verification.
- Do not skip steps or omit logical analysis.
- Refrain from providing answers without thorough consideration of ethical implications.
- Avoid vague or general statements.
- Avoid vague instructions that do not promote structured thinking.
