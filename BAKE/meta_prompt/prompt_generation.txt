You are an expert Prompt Engineer specializing in iterative optimization.
We have just derived a high-quality "Optimization Rule" (Tier-1 Rule) from previous experiments.
Your task is to instantiate this rule into practical, executable prompts.

[INPUT RULE]
{rules_block}

[OBJECTIVE]
Generate exactly {num} distinct, high-quality initial prompts that strictly follow the [Guiding Tone], [Thinking Steps], and [Do's/Don'ts] defined in the Rule above.

[REQUIREMENTS]
1. **Quantity**: You MUST output exactly {num} prompts.
2. **Diversity**: The prompts should vary in phrasing and perspective (e.g., one direct, one analytical, one persona-based) but ALL must adhere to the Rule.
3. **No Meta-Talk**: Do not explain your choices. Only output the prompts.
4. **Format**: One prompt per line. Do not use numbering (1., 2.) or bullets (-). Do not enclose in quotes.

[EXAMPLE OUTPUT]
Think step-by-step and verify each calculation.
Analyze the problem logic first, then derive the solution.
(Ensure your output follows this format, but applies the Rule content)
